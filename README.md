# Ben's Mods to the Perfect Dark PC Port

This is mostly to help me learn the Perfect Dark code and maybe make some cool changes. This is meant for NTSC 1.1/Final only.

Changes include:
* Press G to go into Gangsta Mode whenever you want (hold some guns sideways including the CMP150 and ZZT 9mm)
* Far more corpses are allowed before they start being removed
* Male guards will select from all 42 available heads instead of just 8 like the original game
* Shotgun pellets do more damage and single blast has smaller spread, but magazine size reduced to 8
* Sniper Rifle has new secondary mode, Armor Piercing. Bullets do more damage and penetrate up to 3 objects at the cost of a small accuracy penalty
* All Guns cheat gives the Slayer on all stages, not just Attack Ship and Ruins
* Added a cheat called "Dinner Party"
* Far more bullet holes supported
* Laser weapon leaves scorch marks on props and background
* Twice the smoke puffs supported
* Tinted glass does not become fully opaque
* Laser obstacles stay fully bright even if a room's lights are destroyed
* Stars added on Mr. Blonde's Revenge
* Animated water at the bottom of the chasm in Air Base
* Moved the "Objective Completed/Failed" message down so it doesn't block the center of the screen

Bug fixes:
* Fixed Jonathan being unable to shoot the player in The Duel
* Fixed the bug where wine bottles don't play their shatter sound half the time when destroyed
* Fixed the function indicator not turning yellow during RC-P120 secondary mode
* Fixed a very minor bug where using a light switch would change a room's lighting faster than intended

Stage changes:

Note: These changes require alterations to the game's original files. You can find these files in the build/mods folder.

* Investigation: Added tables with microscopes in some lab rooms
* Investigation: Fixed Night Vision goggles item using the IR Specs model
* Villa: Brightened up the dock clipping tiles, which were oddly dark
* Villa: Fixed the broken texture underneath the stove hood
* Villa: Made some vertex coloring tweaks to the bedroom and bathroom

## Running (Windows only)

These instructions taken from the [PC Port](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark) project by fgsfdsfgs.

You must have a * `ntsc-final`/`US V1.1`/`US Rev 1` (md5 `e03b088b6ac9e0080440efed07c1e40f`) ROM.

This assumes that you're using an x86_64 build. If you aren't, replace `x86_64` below with your arch (e.g. `i686`).

1. Create a directory named `data` next to `pd.x86_64` if it's not there.
2. Put your Perfect Dark NTSC ROM named `pd.ntsc-final.z64` into it.
3. Run the `pd.x86_64` executable.

Optionally, you can also put your Perfect Dark for GameBoy Color ROM named `pd.gbc` in the `data` directory if you want to emulate having the Nintendo 64's Transfer Pak and unlock some cheats automatically.

Additional information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark/wiki).

A GPU supporting OpenGL 3.0/ES3.0 or above is required to run the port.

## Controls

1964GEPD-style and Xbox-style bindings are implemented.

N64 pad buttons X and Y (or `X_BUTTON`, `Y_BUTTON` in the code) refer to the reserved buttons `0x40` and `0x80`, which are also leveraged by 1964GEPD.

Support for one controller, two-stick configurations are enabled for 1.2.

Note that the mouse only controls player 1.

Controls can be rebound in `pd.ini`. Default control scheme is as follows:

| Action           | Keyboard and mouse     | Xbox pad                 | N64 pad                   |

## Building

### Windows

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org).
2. Open the `MINGW64` prompt if building for x86_64, or the `MINGW32` prompt if building for i686. (**NOTE:** _do not_ use the `MSYS` prompt)
3. Install dependencies:  
   `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-i686-toolchain mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-zlib mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-python3 make git`
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Run `cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .`.
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.\
6. Run `cmake --build build -j4 -- -O`.
7. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.x86_64.exe` (or at `build/pd.i686.exe` if building for i686).
8. If you don't know where you downloaded the source to, you can run `explorer .` to open the current directory.

### Linux

1. Ensure you have gcc, g++ (version 10.0+), make, cmake, git, python3 and SDL2 (version 2.0.12+), libGL and ZLib installed on your system.
   * If you wish to crosscompile, you will also need to have libraries and compilers for the target platform installed, e.g. `gcc-multilib` and `g++-multilib` for x86_64 -> i686 crosscompilation.
2. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
3. Run the following command:
   * ```cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .```
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
   * Add ` -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32` at the end of the command if you want to crosscompile from x86_64 to x86.
4. Run `cmake --build build -j4`.
5. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.<arch>` (for example `build/pd.x86_64`).

### MacOS

1. Set up Homebrew.
2. Install dependencies:
   * Execute command: `brew install cmake gcc python3 zlib git`
3. Install SDL2:
   * Execute commands:
     ```
     wget http://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.30.9.dmg -O SDL2.dmg
     hdiutil mount SDL2.dmg
     sudo cp -vr /Volumes/SDL2/SDL2.framework /Library/Frameworks
     hdiutil detach /Volumes/SDL2
     ```
   * This installs SDL2 system-wide and this is how the automatic builds are done. The game will also look for it in the executable path, so you could
     download it locally instead.
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Configure:
   * Execute command: `cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 .`
   * Replace `x86_64` with `arm64` if building for an ARM64 Mac.
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
6. Build:
   * Execute command: `cmake --build build --target pd -j4 --clean-first`
7. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.<arch>` (for example `build/pd.x86_64`).
   * You might need to execute `chmod +x build/pd.x86-64` before you can run it.

### Nintendo Switch

1. Set up the [devkitA64 environment](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).
   * On Windows you can do it under MSYS2 or WSL, usually MSYS2 is recommended.
   * If using MSYS2, make sure to use the **MSYS2** shell, **not** MINGW32 or MINGW64.
2. Install host dependencies:
   * On MSYS2: execute command `pacman -Syuu && pacman -S git make cmake python3`
   * On Linux: use your package manager as normal to install the above dependencies.
3. Install Switch toolchain and dependencies:
   * Execute commands:
     ```
     dkp-pacman -Syuu
     dkp-pacman -S devkitA64 libnx switch-zlib switch-sdl2 switch-cmake dkp-toolchain-vars
     ```
   * If in MSYS2 or `dkp-pacman` doesn't work, replace it with just `pacman`.
4. Get the source code:  
   `git clone --recursive https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/perfect_dark.git && cd perfect_dark`
5. Ensure devkitA64 environment variables are set:
   * Execute command: `source /opt/devkitpro/switchvars.sh`
   * If your `$DEVKITPRO` path is different, substitute that instead or set the variables manually.
6. Configure:
   * Execute command: `aarch64-none-elf-cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" -Bbuild .`
   * Add ` -DROMID=pal-final` or ` -DROMID=jpn-final` at the end of the command if you want to build a PAL or JPN executable respectively.
7. Build:
   * Execute command: `make -C build -j4`
8. The resulting executable will be at `build/pd.arm64.nro`.

### Notes

Alternate compilers or toolchains can be specified by passing `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=whatever` as normal. The port does not build with Visual Studio.

You will need to provide a `jpn-final` or `pal-final` ROM to run executables built for those regions, named `pd.jpn-final.z64` or `pd.pal-final.z64`.

It might be possible to build and run the game on platforms that are not specified in the supported platforms list (e.g. Linux on armv7), but this has not been tested.
